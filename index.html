            <p>For Becky Jackson, who runs two Springfield bars that cater to bikers, motorcycles have been a way of
                life
                since she was growing up with a father and uncle who wore matching vests, shorthand for being in a
                [motorcycle] club.</p>

            <p>A motorcycle (or motorbike) is a vehicle used to transport people from one place to another. It does not
                have 4 wheels like a car. It has 2 wheels like a bicycle. But it has a motor like a car. A motorcycle is
                normally driven by one person. A passenger can also ride on the back of the motorcycle. Some motorcycles
                have a sidecar that can carry another passenger.</p>
